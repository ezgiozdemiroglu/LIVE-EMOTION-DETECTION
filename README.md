We have a cnn template and it predicts the happy sad and shock expressions we add to our dataset.
I used disk and added it to a separate file so that the epoch does not refresh continuously.
I added the frames from the face detection to the test file and took the data from there and tested it. 
To look sad, you may need to make your face slightly sideways and look down.
